#### Week Four Points: 127.9

>That is frustrating when you hit that point in the season where you lose all hope.

John’s magic from his preseason trade with the dingus that traded him Patrick Mahomes is starting to take shape. I am convinced John is selling Chiefs and Cats losses to the football gods in exchange for fantasy dubs. Patty Ice Mahomes and Zeke are starting to heat up. The supporting cast carried their weight for the most part yet again. Even excluding Cordarrelle Patterson’s 30-burger on the bench, John managed 118 points. If John had started Zack Moss in week three, his team would have been undefeated. Perhaps he should have changed his name to the Zack Squad that week. This team may seem inconsistent at times, but they aren’t. This team is terrifying. Somebody, please trade with this man to throw off his team balance. If the Zeke Squad stays injury-free, send the weekly money winnings to John now.

>I had a team of all Lions players one year in FF. It probably would've worked better as a golf team.

In my eyes, K-Man’s team is consistently good. In four weeks, his scores have hit within a score range window of 104-111, which is tighter than a Lions fan’s b-hole during that Justin Tucker walk-off record-breaking field goal last week. Matthew Stafford is proving what everyone knew: the Lions are that bad. Somehow, the Texans are worse. The good news for K-Man is that his fantasy team is better than both teams combined. If you want to beat this team, you better bring your A-game.

>One man's trash is another man's mids level treasure

Brutal loss this week. So close, but yet so far. I hope you find solace in the fact that starting one of your bench players would not have resulted in a win. Dalvin Cook let you down this week. You would have got the dub if he had put up even half of his average score. We call this a “moral victory” in the land of the Wildcats. This is what I prescribe to you to get over this loss. It doesn’t help. In all seriousness, I think this team is better than the record it has. I am not looking forward to playing against HCTM.

>Bama -17 vs Texas A&M seems like disrespect to Bama

Much like Jordan himself: another week, another dub. While this week was not as dominant, a dub is a dub. Many points were left on the bench, which means this team, like A&M opponents of late, did not perform as poorly as expected, regardless, pulled out the victory. Tarv has given himself some padding in the W column. If this team can avoid the injury bug, it could work its way up into the upper class of the league. If not, he may have to resort to his backups. I’d try to avoid that if I were you; we all know how that worked out for the Aggies.

#### Week Four Points: 101.5

>I wonder if Brady can get me the $20

Scooter's team drops 108 points, including an 11-point dud from the most accomplished 'system quarterback' of all time: Tom Brady. Who in the world is Deebo Samuel, and who's throwing him the ball? This man is out here averaging 16.5 points per game. At some point, you can't call it a fluke anymore. I'm officially on the DEEBO TRAIN. Other than Miles "No Smiles" Gaskin and the doo-doo Dolphins defense, the rest of this team showed up this weekend. The depth of this team is NOT GREAT, BOB. But who cares when Noah Fant is averaging seven points per game? It seems like this team is on an upward trend. Scottie is one pecan cold brew away from taking his team to the next level.

#### Week Four Points: 129.9

>I don't want a guy on my team that I hate watching

Much like Cral's Snapchats, this team is a mixed bag that gets better every time you look at it. Unfortunately, Cral took the L this week, but I'll need to see a more disappointing week to count this team out. Cooper Kupp had his first 'disappointing' outing, and he wasn't the only one. The receiving corps looked more like a receiving corpse. Marvin Jones may be in for a long season if Urban Meyer can't keep himself out of trouble, but DJ Chark out for the season after getting steamrolled by his teammate could help. Despite this, I don't want to play against this team. Derrick Henry is an absolute galactico tank. I expect Uncle Cral's Little Dogs will be in every game it plays.

#### Week Four Points: 107.0

>And that was the only happiness I experienced that day

Like the Denver Broncos, I am somewhat skeptical of this team. But I cannot deny the 3-1 record. Other than Najee Harris, this was a rough week for the RBs. When Mike Gesicki is outscoring the combined score of Melvin Gordon and Chris Carson, we have problems. But much like the early Broncos, you still waved the victory flag. The schedule is heating up against the Zeke Squad next week, but unlike the Broncos, this team has the ceiling to beat any team in the league on any night. If the stars align, Claeb’s team could make some moves upward.

#### Week Four Points: 121.5

>Find me three wins on the A&M schedule and I'll give you a dollar

This is a case of a good team with bad luck. I’d say Callen left too many points on the bench, but John also had a sleeping giant on his bench. Like A&M has discovered multiple times this year, Callen found himself in a game he was truly outplayed in. I can’t at 1-3, but I wanted to rank this team higher. Ekeler is a beast this year, and if things start clicking, the Guzzlers could quickly move up to near the top of the rankings by the end of the season. I believe Callen has the eye of the tiger that Jimbo lacks, and unlike the Fightin’ Texas Aggie football team, will claw his way back potentially into a playoff spot.

>Callen, tell your Texans boys to get their shit together. I need a touchdown

Trash, indeed. Like Mike Davis, Adam Thielen, Henry Ruggs, and Michael Pittman this week. If I had a dollar for every time Henry Ruggs dropped a pass last night, I would have a whole lot of money. Gronk being out hurt this team a bit, but he should return in a few weeks. Andrew's team could become a bit dangerous if Adam Thielen and Mike Davis return to their old ways. But at 1-3, this team has some work to do to get out of the hole they've dug for themselves.

#### Week Four Points: 106.2

>How TF do you get blanked 40-0.. Texans need to start over

Not a lot to say here. Tyreek Hill scored nearly half the points, and Trond's team lost by 10. Granted, that can happen when you start players who aren't planning to take the field. Nyheim Hines went all-out with a -0.90 contribution. There's some potential here, but if Georgia Tech football has taught us anything over the years, trying the same thing that's not working doesn't work. There are lots of games left, but this team needs to shake some things up to light a rallying spark

>FF is so dumb. How do I go from being the highest scorer week 1 to having the lowest PF in the entire league?

In the true character of a proper GLOATS Team Lead, Logz started a player listed as 'out' and garnered negative points from his defense, thanks to his starting QB. This week, the saving grace for this team is that DJ Chark got truck-sticked in the ankle and is out for the season. This could open the game for Shenault. That is, if Urban Meyer isn't too hungover on gameday. It was a rough start, but enough games are left to turn it around with some waiver wire magic.

>Sports is dumb. 100%

This team breaks my heart week in and week out. It seems like we are never healthy, and when we are, the ball doesn’t bounce our way in 50/50 plays. I’ve told myself for years that I love this team no matter what, and I do, but all I know is pain. I feel like that little A&M dog lying on the turf with tears in its eyes, but the tears represent both pain and love for me. I will forever be a Wildcat `#emaw`. Now for my fantasy team. This is unequivocally the most fraudulent team on the face of the planet. I cannot rely on my defense to score this many points weekly to make the playoffs. DJ Chark is out for the season three plays into the game. Big Brain Jimmy Neutron moves, starting him at the last second. Les Miles could probably manage this team better than I have been. I will have to find my way onto the waiver wire at some point; otherwise, I’m one injury away from becoming publicly exposed as the fraud I am.
