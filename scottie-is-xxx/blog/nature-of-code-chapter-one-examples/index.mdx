## Introduction to Euclidean Vectors
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector):
> In mathematics, physics, and engineering, a Euclidean vector or simply a vector (sometimes called a geometric vector or spatial vector) is a geometric object that has magnitude (or length) and direction. Euclidean vectors can be added and scaled to form a vector space. A Euclidean vector is frequently represented by a directed line segment, or graphically as an arrow connecting an initial point `A` with a terminal point `B`.

The book references example code in the [Processing programming language](https://processing.org/) that simulates a bouncing ball in two-dimensional space. Below is the core logic:

```csharp title='Bounce.pde'
void draw()
{
  xpos = xpos + (xspeed * xdirection);
  ypos = ypos + (yspeed * ydirection);
  // width-rad and rad refer to the boundaries of the screen
  if (xpos > width-rad || xpos < rad) {
    xdirection *= -1;
  }
  if (ypos > height-rad || ypos < rad) {
    ydirection *= -1;
  }
  ellipseMode(RADIUS);
  fill(random(256));
  ellipse(xpos, ypos, rad, rad);
}
```
This image from the Processing code output shows the ball's movement through vector space. The circle's path is tracked by selecting a random color for the ball on each iteration:

To expand this example to the third dimension, additional variables called `zpos` and `zspeed` are required. Obviously, this approach does not scale well to `n` dimensions since each needs new speed and position variables. While vectors alone don't expand the physics functionality (e.g., the circle's motion), they streamline and minimize the amount of code required to include new dimensions. In JavaScript, we can write a simple class to organize the components and implement vector operations such as addition.

```javascript title='src/components/NatureOfCode/One/NVector/nVector.js'
class NVector {
  constructor(...components) {
    this.components = components;
  }

  get dimensions() {
    return this.components.length;
  }

  // assumes that the second vector has the same dimensions as the first
  add(otherVector) {
    return new NVector(
      ...this.components.map((component, index) => component + otherVector.components[index])
    );
  }
}
```

After instantiating two `NVector` objects, a third vector can be created to capture the sum. This vector addition is the basis for simulating motion:
```javascript
let circleLocation = new NVector(1, 2, 3);
const circleVelocity = new NVector(4, 5, 6);
circleLocation = circleLocation.add(circleVelocity);
// { components: [5, 7, 9] }
console.log(circleLocation);
```

In other words:
$$
\overrightarrow{location} = \overrightarrow{location} + \overrightarrow{velocity}
$$
Or:
$$
location_{x} = location_{x} + velocity_{x}
$$
$$
location_{y} = location_{y} + velocity_{y}
$$
$$
location_{z} = location_{z} + velocity_{z}
$$

Vector subtraction behaves the same way as addition:
```javascript title='src/components/NatureOfCode/One/NVector/nVector.js'
// assumes that the second vector has the same dimensions as the first
subtract(otherVector) {
  return new NVector(
    ...this.components.map((component, index) => component - otherVector.components[index])
  );
}
```

For multiplication, there are both scalar and vector products:
```javascript title='src/components/NatureOfCode/One/NVector/nVector.js'
scale(scalar) {
  return new NVector(...this.components.map(component => component * scalar));
}

// assumes that the second vector has the same dimensions as the first
dot(otherVector) {
  return this.components.reduce((sum, component, index) => sum + component * otherVector.components[index], 0);
}
```

Scalar multiplication can be written as (where `n` is a single number):
$$
\overrightarrow{w} = \overrightarrow{u} * n
$$
Or:
$$
w_{x} = u_{x} * n
$$
$$
w_{y} = u_{y} * n
$$
$$
w_{z} = u_{z} * n
$$

```javascript
const u = new NVector(1, 3, 5);
const n = 3
const w = u.scale(n);
// { components: [3, 9, 15] }
console.log(w);
```

For dot products (where `n` is the dimension of vector space):
$$
{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}u_{i}v_{i}=u_{1}v_{1}+u_{2}v_{2}+\cdots +u_{n}v_{n}}
$$

```javascript
const u = new NVector(1, 3, -5);
const v = new NVector(4, -2, -1);
const w = u.dot(v);
// 3
console.log(w);
```

Lastly, a vector's magnitude (or length) can be calculated like so:
$$
{\displaystyle \|\mathbf {u} \|={\sqrt {u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}+\cdots +u_{n}^{2}}}.}
$$
